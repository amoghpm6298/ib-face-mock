// How the model writes to the record: tool calls, not a JSON blob.
//
// WHAT THIS REPLACES. The model answered with one JSON object carrying
// everything at once — prose, question bookkeeping, findings, dimensions, the
// strategy and the blueprint. Four separate problems came out of that single
// shape:
//
//  1. THE DEADLOCK. `barriers` existed in the "ask" template and not the
//     "propose" one, while the prompt said "You cannot propose without both"
//     and the gate enforced it. One hand-maintained shape in two places
//     cannot be kept consistent, and nothing checked.
//  2. THE DEAD STREAM. Prose sat behind six machine fields, so the UI had
//     nothing to show until the payload was nearly complete — and fell back
//     to scraping `"summary"` out of half-finished JSON with a regex.
//  3. THE PROMPT CAP. Roughly 7,350 of 33,500 characters were hand-written
//     JSON schemas. Adding one field meant trading against tests that pin
//     method sentences verbatim.
//  4. NO PARTIAL CREDIT. One malformed field invalidated the whole turn, so a
//     good finding was lost because an unrelated part of the payload was
//     wrong.
//
// Tool calls fix all four structurally. The schema lives in the API's own
// `tools` parameter where it costs no prompt budget and the API enforces it;
// prose becomes a plain text block that streams; each call is validated and
// applied on its own, so one bad call does not discard the others.
//
// SCOPE. These three tools feed the RECORD, which is what the gate blocks on
// and where every measured deadlock lived. `propose_strategy` and
// `build_campaign` are a separate pass: the blueprint grammar is the single
// largest artefact in the prompt and converting it deserves its own change
// rather than riding along with this one.
