// that?
//
// WHAT THIS COLLAPSES. Sixteen independent places could block the agent: nine
// checks inside `evaluateDiscovery`, four vetoes computed separately in the
// orchestrator and ORed with the gate's own outcome, five refusals in the
// architecture audits, and seven MAX_/MIN_ constants spread across two files.
// No single function could answer "why is this stuck", and on 2026-10-16 three
// of them turned out to be unclearable — the gate demanded a field the
// response template had no slot for, held out for a `note` nobody had been
// told to write, and kept refusing after the round budget was spent because
// the escape hatch was overridden by vetoes that never read it.
//
// THE INVARIANT, and the reason this file exists at all:
//
//   every Block names the mutation that clears it, and applying that mutation
//   clears it.
//
// `clears` is a REQUIRED field, so a block that cannot say what would fix it
// is not merely discouraged — it cannot be constructed. `satisfy()` below is
// the executable definition of each mutation, which is what lets the property
// test check the invariant instead of trusting it. Anything worth telling the
// agent that does NOT have a clearing mutation is advice, and advice does not
// block.
