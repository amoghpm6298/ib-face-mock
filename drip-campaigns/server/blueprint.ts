   * explicit attachment point for the FIRST step only — the next step called
   * `nextInChain`, which looks at every open slot in the WHOLE graph. An
   * experiment with two arms leaves two open slots, so from the second step
   * of either arm the answer was always "2 open slots exist; the continuation
   * is ambiguous" and the rest of that arm was dropped. Measured live: a
   * two-arm, six-step experiment produced a canvas with zero message steps.
   *
   * Ambiguity ACROSS arms is not ambiguity WITHIN one. The slot a step just
   * opened is not a candidate the compiler has to choose between; it is the
   * only place this path can continue. So the chain follows the node it just
   * added, and `nextInChain` stays for the genuinely open case — a top-level
   * step with no attachment point of its own.
