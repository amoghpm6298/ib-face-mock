// The chat bubble is a colleague, not the lab notebook.
//
// All of this comes from one four-turn PIN-activation run, where the parts
// written BY the application read worse than the parts written by the model.
//
//   Turn 1: "I've sent these two questions to the campaign manager."
//     Written to the manager, about the manager, in the third person.
//
//   Turn 3: "I have put up two possible groups to go after and I am waiting
//     to hear which one you would back." Then, underneath:
//       What I am working through:
//       - Acquisition channel or offer type at sign-up — set aside: ...
//       - Credit limit assigned: Manager states higher assigned credit limit
//         correlates with faster activation; a real candidate segmentation
//         axis for dosage/intensity.
//     Three bullets that are not the two groups, in our vocabulary rather
//     than theirs, with "set aside" as a status and "Manager states" as the
//     voice.
//
//   The activity panel, meanwhile: "Agent thinking", "6 lookups" on a turn
//     that looked nothing up, and a Details panel that opened into raw JSON
//     with no sentence anywhere in it.
//
// The record is not the problem and is not hidden. It stays on the brief and
// in the `discovery.questions` event's `data`. What changed is that it is no
// longer pasted into the conversation.
