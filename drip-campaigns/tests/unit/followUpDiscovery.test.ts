// Discovery is a conversation, not a questionnaire.
//
// The defect this locks down, measured across every OS-to-EMI run to date: the
// agent asked three good opening questions, received the answers, closed every
// dimension on that same turn, and proposed. It never tested whether an answer
// had NARROWED a question rather than settled it.
//
// `aud4` is the clearest case. The user said the blocker is "interest-cost
// hesitation, not awareness". That is a family of explanations, not one — the
// interest rate, the total amount payable, the tenure, the effect on available
// limit — and they lead to different opening messages. The agent recorded it as
// a closed dimension, basis "user", and wrote a campaign around "interest-cost
// transparency" without ever asking which part of the cost was the worry.
//
// The stopping rule is deliberately NOT a question count in either direction:
// a fixed number would be as wrong as stopping at the first answer.
