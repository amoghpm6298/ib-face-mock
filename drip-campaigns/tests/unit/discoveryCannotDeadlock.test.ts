// Discovery must always be able to end.
//
// THE MEASURED FAILURE, from a live session on new-cardholder activation. The
// agent asked the same question three turns running, verbatim, while the
// campaign manager answered it every time and eventually wrote "im tired man".
// Three independent defects stacked, and each one alone was enough:
//
// 1. `converters` and `barriers` existed only in the ASK payload. The prompt
//    said "You cannot propose without both" and the gate enforced exactly
//    that, so on a propose turn the model had nowhere to declare the barrier
//    it had just been given. The gate then refused with "I do not yet know
//    what is stopping them" and re-asked. Guaranteed, not probabilistic.
//
// 2. `unresolvedDimensions` holds a proposal while a dimension sits on
//    `basis: 'assumption'` with no `note`. Nothing in the brief said a note
//    was what the application wanted, so the model did the only other thing
//    the refusal suggested — asked another question — and the refusal
//    regenerated identically.
//
// 3. `evaluateDiscovery` escapes at the round limit, but four vetoes computed
//    in the orchestrator were ORed with its outcome and none of them read the
//    limit. The escape hatch existed and was overridden.
//
// Each test below fails if its defect returns.
