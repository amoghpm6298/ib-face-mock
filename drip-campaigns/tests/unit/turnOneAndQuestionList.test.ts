// Two defects from one live run, 2026-10-21. Both are about what the manager
// sees on screen rather than about what the agent knows.
//
// THE RUN, three turns, verbatim where quoted.
//
//   Turn 1, the agent: "I checked the channels and template availability."
//     Then three numbered questions. The manager had said what they wanted
//     and the first thing back was an inventory of the plumbing.
//
//   Turn 2, the manager: "1. Activation means setting the PIN 2. We measure
//     how many new cardholders activate"
//     The agent: "Confirmed so far: activation means setting the PIN, and
//     success is read as more cardholders activating."
//     Underneath, the client listed those same two questions again.
//
//   Turn 3: five numbered questions on screen, two of them ones the agent had
//     just said in writing were settled.
//
// DEFECT 1 is the question list: the discovery return sent `outstanding(brief)`
// — every question still open across the whole conversation — so the list only
// ever grew, and anything the record had not closed reappeared under the
// sentence saying it was closed. The brief rightly keeps the history; the
// client should show this turn's ask.
//
// DEFECT 2 is the opening move: `list_channels` and `check_template_availability`
// were the only two tools available before a plan is approved, so a model
// inclined to look something up first had exactly one thing it could look up.
// Turn one could not have been anything else.
//
// The two fixes are independent and both are structural — one changes what a
// return carries, the other what the first turn can reach. Neither is prompt
// wording, which is this project's standing lesson about what moves behaviour.
