// A plan ready to approve must not arrive looking like a form.
//
// THE LIVE RUN, EMI. The strategy appeared with Confirm and one numbered
// question underneath it — "Does every EMI-eligible purchase share the same
// 7-day expiry?" Answering that question is what took the manager off
// Confirm: the reply became a discovery turn, and the plan they were one
// click from approving went back into the conversation. Clicking Confirm
// instead produced the graph immediately.
//
// So the highest-frequency miss on this path is not the compiler. It is the
// PAIRING — an approvable plan shown beside something that reads as a
// questionnaire — and the thing that made it a questionnaire was the
// application, not the model:
//
//   - `recordQuestions` put the leftovers on the brief as OUTSTANDING, which
//     makes the next typed message an answer rather than a decision;
//   - the response returned them in `questions`, which the client renders as
//     a numbered list under the agent's own message.
//
// Both stop on this path. Nothing is hidden: these items are
// `strategic-ambiguity` by construction, they were already in
// `gate.openItems`, and `renderStrategy` already prints that kind under
// "Worth settling before this is built".
//
// DISCOVERY BEFORE A STRATEGY IS UNCHANGED, and the last describe here is
// what holds that: `ask_questions` still returns numbered questions, still
// capped at three, and still records them. There is no plan to approve on
// that turn, so asking is the whole point.
