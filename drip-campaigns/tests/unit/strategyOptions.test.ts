// The defect this locks down, measured on a real OS-to-EMI run (`aud4`): the
// journey step was a flat menu of things to "consider only where they earn
// their place", with a one-directional rule against adding anything. Nothing
// required a verdict on any of them. So the run never mentioned segmentation
// at all — despite discovery having found a genuine segmentation axis, the
// funnel stage of the target customer — and dismissed an A/B test with the
// reasoning that "no prior performance data exists to size or motivate a
// specific variable test yet", which has the argument backwards: no history is
// the reason to run a comparison, not a reason to skip one.
//
// Nothing in the output distinguished "weighed and set aside" from "never
// thought about", which is how a journey ends up a linear chain of sends by
// default rather than by decision.
