// Confirm crashed, every time, for every conversation.
//
// THE LIVE FAILURE. The manager pressed "Confirm and generate" and got two
// agent bubbles:
//
//   Illegal state transition AWAITING_STRATEGY_CONFIRMATION -> CONFIGURATION_INCOMPLETE.
//   The connection closed before the run finished.
//
// Two defects, one in each half of the stack.
//
// THE SERVER. Generation is two hops — `AWAITING_STRATEGY_CONFIRMATION ->
// GENERATING_CAMPAIGN -> (EXPORT_ELIGIBLE | CONFIGURATION_INCOMPLETE)`. The
// `isBuildTurn` tail took one, and `AWAITING_STRATEGY_CONFIRMATION` legally
// reaches only `GENERATING_CAMPAIGN` — the table calls it "the only door into
// generation" — so `transition` threw. The refinement path had the same skip
// and hid it by assigning the state as a bare string: no throw, and a built
// campaign that never passed through generation. The table is not what was
// wrong; widening it would delete the guarantee it exists to give.
//
// WHY NO TEST CAUGHT IT, and the part worth remembering. There IS a confirm
// path that has always had both hops — the short-circuit guarded by
// `intent === 'confirm' && req.confirmedBlueprint`. Every existing test
// supplies `confirmedBlueprint` directly and therefore walks that one. The
// real client cannot: it sends `confirmedBlueprint: pendingBlueprint`, and a
// propose turn returns `pendingBlueprint: null` BY DESIGN, so the guard never
// passes in the app and every live Confirm fell through to the broken tail.
// A test that passes `confirmedBlueprint` here would prove the path that was
// never in question. This one sends null.
//
// THE CLIENT. `stream.ts` set `sawResult` only on a result frame, so an error
// frame called `onError` and left it false — and when the socket closed the
// fallback fired a second time. That is the second bubble: one real failure,
// one invented, and the invented one read last.
