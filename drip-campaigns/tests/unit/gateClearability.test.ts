// Every block names the mutation that clears it, and applying that mutation
// clears it.
//
// This is the invariant the rebuild exists to enforce, and it is the one thing
// 884 passing tests could not express. Every deadlock measured on 2026-10-16
// violates it:
//
//  - the gate demanded `barriers` while the propose payload had no slot for
//    them, so the named fix was unreachable;
//  - it held out for a dimension `note` without the note being a named fix at
//    all, so the agent asked another question and the refusal regenerated;
//  - it kept refusing past the round budget, so no mutation could clear it
//    because the budget was not consulted.
//
// None of those is a logic error you can see by reading one function. They are
// all the same shape: a refusal with no reachable exit. So this file does not
// test behaviours one at a time — it enumerates blocking states and checks the
// property holds for all of them.
