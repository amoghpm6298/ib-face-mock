// Entry is every eligible customer who has not done the behaviour. Always.
//
// A TREND IS NOT A TARGET. Knowing who is likelier to convert changes what
// those people GET — a different cadence, channel, wording, an extra touch on
// one path — and never whether they are in the campaign. The remainder keeps
// a path either way.
//
// WHAT THIS SLICE FIXES, and it is copy rather than compiler. Three places
// put a menu of groups to the manager:
//
//   - §2 of SYSTEM named a standing list of customer differences and told the
//     agent to "ask which one they would back";
//   - `briefForPrompt` ended its candidate block with "Then ask which they
//     would back. Do not pick a target and proceed as though they had agreed
//     to it" — a choice of audience, put to someone whose audience is already
//     decided;
//   - the gate's clearing instruction called them "candidate segments".
//
// All three now read as TRENDS TO TEST inside one entry set. And the factor
// lists are gone: the examples in §2 were EMI-shaped, so every objective got
// EMI's dimensions back.
//
// THE NO-HISTORY CASE is the other half. "We have seen no pattern" or "we do
// not track it" means one track for everyone eligible — and the campaign
// still has to learn something, by testing whatever THIS objective is
// actually uncertain about. No history is a reason to test, not a reason to
// ship the shyest flat sequence.
